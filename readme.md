I solve coding problems from sites like hackerearth, hackerank every once in a while. And because of being a compulsive clean coder, more often than not, I spend time to take a improve a solution both in complexity and readability, more latter than former. So I thought to create a repo out of all problems I do in a process format, such that each coding problem is a jupyter notebook, where I first solve it and then try to improve upon it. The problem solving is done in python 3.6.
